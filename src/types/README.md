# src/types

Contains type declaration files (d.ts) for Typescript.

This is particularly useful for [declaration merging](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/declaration-merging.html), allowing us to extend the Express Request object to define our own properties on it.

These properties can then be added in our middleware and used in our route handlers.
